# Predicting Solar Power output using linear regression
Project Overview


A machine learning project using Pandas and NumPy.

This project aims to predict solar power output using environmental factors such as temperature and sunlight intensity. By applying Linear Regression, we provide an efficient way to estimate energy generation and optimize solar panel performance.
